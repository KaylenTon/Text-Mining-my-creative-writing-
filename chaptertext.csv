ACT,CHAPTER TITLE,TEXT
1,My Ear,"I return home late—a quarter past two in the morning. After going over what would be lecture material for Dr. Crawford in April, Terry and Basil demonstrated proficiency over the Flow Rebalance Maneuver technique, nailing it within only the last hour of our four-hour session. I figured I had an easier time developing and mastering it due to my talent to naturally perceive beos outside my own body, but Terry and Basil picked it up a lot faster than I did. 
That goes to show what an excellent teacher I am. I love it—teaching, healing without the stakes of a life. Sure, I’m confident I can help injured people, but witnessing real wounds pains my heart in ways I don’t know how to recover from. It’s not like I can heal people blind or wipe my memory afterwards. 
And after saying good night to Basil, Terry and I took a train to the heart of Astran: Galaxia city. While stars are easily visible in our district, Galaxia city is where they twinkle the most. And under that glittering sky, Terry rented a raft for us to float around while laying down in the river. He packed a rolled up futon on the train to spread on the logs and brought us pillows and a medium sized blanket to cuddle under. I wish we could have slept under the stars for the night. For almost an hour, we did sleep until he started feeling cold and fussing about me hogging the blanket. Next time, he promises to bring a bigger blanket. A promise it is. I look forward to seeing my lover boy under only the gleam of the starlit sky again. Even if all the stars were to die and Galaxia lost its shine, just being with him is all I need.

I click the front door closed, locking it from the inside. My eyes widen and I just stare at my hands on the lock—frozen.
He’s coming up right behind me. 
Slowly, I turn around.
“Did I wake you up again?” I whisper. “Sorry. I just—”
He grabs my ear, gripping it strongly. 
The corners of my mouth go up in discomfort. I’m confused on what it is this time. “Ow…” I quietly wince, hoping he’ll let go. I don’t dare grab his wrist or force him to unhand me. If he were to jerk his arm, raising it in a swift motion, what would that mean for me? Ears are thin, and he’s squeezing hard enough to not allow me to reconcentrate my beos in my ear defensively. Does he know—that it hurts more than usual? That he might actually do worse than before? If I tell him, would he take advantage of it—of how defenseless my ear is right now? I can never know, and not knowing scares me.
He raises my ear, thankfully slowly so that I can accommodate by standing on my toes, maximizing my height, but I’m afraid these couple inches is the most I can add. 
“Why are you doing this?” I ask. 
“Why do you have ears if you never listen?” He shouts into it—my ear. My drums vibrate, and I can feel his spit bubbles land inside. The cohesive nature of water makes it join with my sweat. I feel disgusting and painfully red, and I don’t even know what he’s referring to.
“I’m sorry. I’ll listen.” I panic, holding his wrist to pull it down because my toes can’t lift me any higher. And as I feared, it was a mistake—grabbing him. 

He’s walking away, and I’m holding a chunk of my detached outer ear in the palm of my hand. My right hand in front of my chest, palm up, holding my left ear, and my left hand holding the side of my head, where my left ear is supposed to be. 
And it appears I’ve been standing here for a little too long, staring at a piece of myself. The blood has dried down my neck and arm and has become flaky. My snot and tears on my face have also dried and become sticky. Then my mother opens the front door, coming home after another long day of work, meaning it’s at least past five a.m.
My eyes look up to meet hers. And I don’t know why at this moment, time and everything is two steps ahead of me, but it finally hits me that she sees what I see. I close up my hand and turn around, walking to my bathroom, not even welcoming my mother home. She walks faster behind me, catching up and turning me around by my shoulder. She pulls my arm down, revealing red, torn flesh. I cover it up again, closing my fingers.
“AARON!” She screams his name, horrifyingly upset. 
“SHUT THE FUCK UP!” is how he responds. I didn’t realize he’s still awake.
My mother sits me down at the breakfast bar stool. First she cleans the wound, wiping me then flashing a sterilization spell. 
The rest—I didn’t feel. Not until she starts touching and bending it—cartilage of my auricle. Of course. My mother and father are experts at treating injuries. My eyes shift up to her ID zipped to her shirt—that lotus flower symbol, representing that my mother is capable of regenerating body parts as long as improper healing wasn’t already done. It’s a rare skill that only a handful of doctors have. 
“It’s okay now. You still even have your little mole. Almost as if it never happened.” My mother rubs my back shoulder in a circular motion, giving me that deafening smile of hers. “I’m going to talk to him, alright?”
“He said to shut the fuck up,” I remind. 
“Koffee… don’t say that. I’m his wife. He listens to me. He does.”
“So do you tell him to do this?”
“No. Of course not.”
“Do you ever tell him to not do this?”
“Almost every day.”
“Then he doesn’t listen to you.”
I get up and go to my bedroom. We’ve had this conversation many times. It never changes. Tomorrow, she’ll ‘talk’ to him. She’ll tell me over text he apologized, say it’s my turn, and ask that I forgive him. And of course, I do. We’re family. Then I forgive her. Because she lies.

As I stand under the raining shower head, I stare, looking at my warpy reflection in the shower’s big, square faucet handle. I have both of my ears. I hear perfectly fine. Just as mother said, it’s like it never even happened. Physically. But that’s as far as healing treatments can go. Because it did happen. And I’ll always remember it. I still do. I still feel it: his tight grip, the first tear—but I know she did everything right. There’s no nerve damage or complications to Dr. Morgan’s procedures, but I don't know how long it’ll take for me to stop constantly feeling it every second of the day—despite her technique being so flawless. Because this isn't the first time this shit’s happened. It’s happened plenty of times before. Sure, I’ve never had my outer ear torn off the side of my head (it’s always something new), but…
I pat around my head with my fingers, crouching down closer to get a better look of my reflection through the faucet handle. While it does distort my appearance, it also acts like a magnifying mirror, zooming in on the corner of my hairline. There. It’s been so long that I nearly forgot about it. Can I say time heals when nothing has changed?
Though so faint, this is the most visible scar I have. I’m glad I have it—even if I never openly talk about it. To me, it’s a testament of strength—proof of my resilience and evidence of survival. I’m glad it scarred. I’m glad I was so young, not yet having perfected my pebble assisted stitching technique. Because if I didn’t have this scar, could I talk about it like it even happened? Would people believe me? Or even now—could it just be from carelessly untrimmed, long nails that self-inflicted this rather than a father slamming a door with his daughter’s head in-between?
Because with doctors and healers, we can only fix physical wounds. When the cuts and bruises fade and no scar remains, everyone assumes it’s all fine—that nothing ever happened. But it hurt. I remember it hurt, and I still feel the hurt.
Still, I am fortunate I have a medical expert as my mother, and I have my ear back to normal. Is it a perk—being part of this monetarily, opportunity-providing family? Or would it be better if I hadn’t been born to them at all? Wouldn’t that be the real blessing? Maybe not. She always tells me: ‘things could be worse’, but I like to wonder if things could be better.
The steam building up is making it hard to breathe. How long have I been standing here? The shower glass is all fogged up, and I haven’t even started with my shampoo. "
1,My Sanctuary,"I apparently took ninety minutes in the shower. I usually complete my full shower routine in under fifteen. Now the sun’s fully risen, and I haven’t slept. After getting out of the shower, I wiped down the glass and tiles dry and left the vent on. It’ll stay on for a couple days, because I won’t be home—not for a while at least. I packed two bags: my backpack and a medium duffel bag with my clothes, toiletries, books, electronics, and my two fat sleeping pillows. 
I knock on his apartment door.
I gave him a call before my shower, asking if I could stay over. He said yes in that deep, groggy, raspy morning voice of his. I’ll get to wake up to that for a couple days. I’m looking forward to it.
“Coming!” I hear him yawning from outside. I also… see him walking towards the door, rubbing his eye, wiping what might’ve been drool…
He opens the door (with a shiny moisture at the corner of his mouth—drool confirmed) and pulls me in for a hug—or maybe he just needed some support standing. “Your hair’s wet.” He pinches a lock from the middle to its ends, squeezing out water droplets.
“I just took a shower.”
“Come in.” He stands up straight and moves aside for me to step in. He shuts and locks the door behind me then takes my bags. “Go to the restroom. I’ll dry your hair.” 
I start drying my hair using his blow dryer while he settles my stuff in his bedroom. When he hears it turn on, he quickly runs in—playfully hand-chopping the top of my head and taking the dryer from me. 
“Hey! I said I’d dry it.” He starts with a towel. 
“Okay.” I stare at myself in the mirror, not able to unglue my eyes from my left ear. “Do I look any different?”
He looks ahead, into the mirror, scanning my reflection. “You took your earrings off… You look tired. Did you sleep?”
“Not much.” Not at all. Nothing aside from sleeping on his shoulder on the train ride back. “Anything else look different to you?”
“You look sad.” He raises his eyebrows, looking at me in the mirror, as if asking me: Am I right? Are you okay? What’s the matter? You can tell me. You can trust me.
“Yeah,” my voice cracks. “I am sad.” I gulp, suppressing that lump in my throat. I stare at it as I force it down. Then after, I realize he’s still looking at me through the mirror. I break into a cry, sinking my face into my hands. Everything stings. My heart, my nose, my eyes, and my ear.
“We can talk about it after, okay?” He turns on the blow dryer and starts working through my hair. It’s loud, but I can’t hide my cries.
“Okay.”

	Sitting on his bed, I tell Terry everything that happened last night.
	When he finishes braiding my hair, he examines my ear. “You still have your mole.”
	I didn’t even know I had a mole back there. I mean, how could I? But by remarking that, does that mean he doubts my truth?
“I have proof.”
“I don’t need photos. Your piercing’s gone.”
“I have the tissue—in my mini-fridge.”
 “Love, I believe you. Your father’s insane, and your mom is truly something… but I get it—wanting the scars to show that you survived it, maybe to even guilt the perpetrator, make them carry the shame. But while it is unfair, it’s ultimately our responsibility to heal from what has been done to us. It’s hard when it’s invisible, but I think it’d be a lot harder if your ear were permanently gone and your hearing became… compromised. You know the complications, I’m sure. It’d be a constant reminder of what was done.”
Yes, I know. And for brief hours, I did experience it. Though it was dead night and almost silent, there was still the fridge, our heater, and the spongy sound of my blood squelched between my hand and the upper corner of my jaw. Without the pinna, sounds to that ear become unclear: harsh, compressed, and directionless.
“I don’t want that for you. Memories are scary enough,” he adds. “And most importantly…” he crawls in front of me, “I would no longer be able to do this.” He tucks a lock of hair behind my newly regrown ear, smiling not differently than how he did before. Sunlight beams through his window, shining on him. His brunette bed hair which I never bothered to fix gleams golden brown like fresh, out of the oven pastries. And his eyes—they’re a deep infinity beef stew with carrots and chives. 
My stomach grumbles. I didn’t sleep through the hours, so I am hungry.
I look down at my hands and tear at my fingernails. 
He stops me, putting his hand atop mine. “I can clip them,” he says then steps off the bed to get his nail clipper. “Then we can go out for breakfast. I don’t have much in my fridge. I’m going to grocery shop and meal-prep later today.”
His nails are always trimmed—maybe even filed. It’s nice to see he cares for himself as much as I do—as much as I love him. 
He hops back onto the bed, taking my hand and clipping my fingers. His demeanor changes as he focuses. “For injuries other than amputations, would you prefer a scar left behind? Is that why when it’s abrasions and cuts, you don’t heal yourself? Do you ever think I’m like your mother—when I heal you? I try my best to not leave scars.”
I pause to collect my thoughts. The silence behind the nail clippings between us isn’t tense at all. And that’s one of my favorite things about us. Terry is my sanctuary. He’s my lighthouse in the dark fog, my anchor in crashing currents. And after the bad things, I run to him. Because he’s my breath of fresh air after a house fire and my rainbow after it storms. 
If I compare the way my mother treats my injuries and the way Terry does… “It’s not the same,” I say. “You’re different.”
“How so?”
	“I know my mother loves me. But when she does things, there feels like an ulterior motive. Her words that come after—they always sweetly invalidate how I feel. You never do that.” 
He finishes clipping my last nail then starts collecting them in the palm of his hand. I love the way he listens. Even if it pains him to hear or see me like this, I’m glad to feel known and be loved so deeply by someone.
“You heal me flawlessly because you don’t want to give me scars. She heals me flawlessly because she doesn’t want the scars to be seen. It’s like—you care for the Koffee in me, while she only cares for the Morgan name I share with our family.”
Terry hops off his bed after collecting the last finger nail and dusts his hands off above his trash can. He turns back around to look at me. He engulfs me in a hug. Unfortunately, the thick fabrics of our sweaters in his chilly apartment create too much space between us. “Do you want to eat something from the deli at Sunny’s Farmers Market?” he asks. “Is that okay with you?” He breaks the hug but not our touch to read my face.
I nod in agreement. Their sandwiches are good. 

Terry and I make bites out of our sandwiches as he pushes the shopping cart around the store. 
“Don’t do that again,” he told me for swiping my card at the deli’s register when we ordered our sandwiches.
My mother wired me money this morning—it’s financial compensation for the troubles at home. Of course I accept it—not because money resolves everything but because I’m staying with Terry for a while. I don’t want him to pay every dollar of my living like he said he’d do.
After he bags every food and drink item on his grocery list, I swipe my card again at the self-checkout.
“Koffee!” He groans, swinging his head back dramatically. “I hate being on bagging duty with you.” What a kid.
“Be quiet!” I laugh. “If you complain again, I’ll—I’ll go home!” I joke, trying to pop my eyes out like he frequently does his, but I think I just look stupid. I’m staying for at least a week. I need a week’s worth of waking up to his bed hair and raspy voice. 
“Fine. Don’t say that though.”
We walk towards the exit. Then he halts and turns back. “Wait here.” He leaves me. Perhaps he forgot something. I review the grocery list one more time, trying to make a guess to occupy my time. Is there something he could have forgotten to write down—something that would compliment a different food already listed? I scan his list up and down, many times over. 
Flowers! I suddenly remember: today is the third scheduled date for a Novus lecture. Terry said on the third and fourth date, he’d have funerals to attend. 
Terry comes running back with a bouquet wrapped in decorative paper, but the flower assortment comprises of pink tulips and white gypsophila. It looks… romantic.
“For the funeral?” I ask. It doesn’t seem very appropriate.
“Uh. No. For you. It’s February now.” He hands the bouquet to me. “But good reminder.” And he runs back to buy two more, more appropriate flowers for a funeral. 
He insists on carrying all the groceries while I just hold the three bouquets as we take the bus back to his place. 
“Not a purple this time?” I ask as I whiff the florals. 
Though I like pink, Terry has always chosen me predominantly purple-hued flower arrangements. Tinges of other colors at times, like coral and teal, for contrast and to not make the purple an eyesore. I never said anything before because I know he chooses it since it resembles me, and I like any time and reason I’m on his mind.
“I think it’s good to switch things up. My love isn’t the same as last year’s.” He tucks a lock of my hair behind my ear and kisses my cheek. “Pink and red are the more traditional Valentine colors anyway, and you like pink. I’ll stop being selfish, getting you my preference every time.”
“I like purple too,” I say. “Thank you for the flowers.” I peck him back then lean on his shoulder—kind of drowsy.
“No problem, Valentine.”
“Oh—So you’re not even going to ask?” I laugh, jerking my head up and facing him. 
He smiles and shakes his head. No, you’re already mine anyway, he’s probably thinking. 
I fall asleep on his shoulder for the remainder of the bus ride.

While preparing meals in his kitchen, I ask him: “Who are the funerals for? You never mentioned who.”
“Emails went out. Tina Blue and Chelsea Hoppins passed away recently.”
“Oh. I did open those,” I realize. Two healers who work at our hospitals died (not on the job). They were young: twenty-eight and forty-four, if I remember correctly. “I didn’t get any funeral invite though.”
“Of course not. Our family’s not inviting the entire hospital staff.”
“Family?” 
“Yeah. They’re super distant though. I’ve only spoken with them a few times professionally. You never met them. I barely know them either. They didn’t have many people in their lives. That’s why my parents insist we go, so I’m going. Do you want to come with me—at five?”
“I didn’t bring formal black clothes.” I’m also really tired.
“That’s fine then. You can just stay at my place or do whatever.”
“Are you sad?” I ask. 
No one in my life has ever passed away. I’ve never experienced that type of grief. I feel like I made everything about myself this morning. Two women in his family died. I don’t think death is the worst thing in the world, but—without a doubt—nothing is more permanent than death. 
“I didn’t know them that well, but it is tragic—because they were both expecting.” His lips twist and he halts cutting the boiled chicken breast. “You know what’s weird? Tina’s husband left her, taking the kid they already had together, accusing her of ‘infidelity’ and calling her insane. Yeah, infidelity is bad—but the autopsy returned an unborn fetus so anomalic it didn’t look human.”
“What do you mean?”
“I don’t know. I didn’t see it.” He shrugs. “That’s just what people are saying. But what I’m saying is—if we got married and had a kid, and I discovered through an ultrasound that you were pregnant with a peacock, I wouldn’t take our kid and leave you. I’d get you some help. Who the fuck cheats with an animal and doesn’t try to cover up their tracks? That’s weird. If you cheated on me with another man or animal, wouldn’t you hide it from me?” 
“I wouldn’t reproduce with an animal. That’s gross to think about—and impossible.” Laying an egg seems easier than live birth though. “And I wouldn’t cheat on you.”
“But if you did—and you ended up pregnant but didn’t want to admit it,” Terry pesters for a hypothetical answer.
“I don’t want to answer in case you start to get the wrong ideas from me, but… I guess she could get an abortion. And if the fetus was that defected, it’d be best to. For their quality of life.” 
“Exactly. And Chelsea did have an abortion. Hers was also severely abnormal. Soon after, she and her husband filed a report and opened a case together. Then they died in their sleep a following night,” Terry says. His tense expression settles. “Anyway, it turned out, Tina’s baby was 100% human DNA. And it belonged to her ex-husband too. His name is Chris. Chris,” Terry points ahead with the knife, “you’re a bad man.” Then he returns to cutting up tofu squares.
We honestly might have this story all wrong. Context matters before any judgement, such as: did Chris see any of these ultrasounds? True or not, were these accusations of infidelity from reasons outside of the pregnancy? 
That’s the thing with some people in healthcare, making wrong diagnoses because of a bias in their head thinking: wow, my patient is so abnormal and interesting. And all the gossip too, of course. From rumors, you’ll never know what’s true and what’s fake. And honestly, it’s not our business to know or judge unless we are their caretaker. In this case, none of us were. 
All I’m relieved about is Terry interpreting all of whatever bits of information he has with empathy for the women who died but also with suspicion. I don’t think this was all solely a result of their own actions. Two messed up fetuses and three people passed away. I pray every one of them is able to rest in peace. 
Ghosts wander on Earth for a while—I assume because the world isn’t overpopulated with them. Either they eventually get recycled or transcend somewhere else—somewhere or some form that even I cannot perceive. 

Later that night while Terry and I are sleeping together, I wake up. My chest experiences short burns of tightness. It’s too difficult to leave alone. I’m reliving that moment over and over again, holding onto my own ear, softly caressing it with my thumb. I feel stupid for not bringing my medication with me, especially after what happened last night. 
Slowly and gently, I try to undo Terry’s cuddle, pushing his arms off me. I try not to wake him, but he groans.
“Fine,” he mumbles, half-asleep and half-awake. He rolls away, facing the wall.
I get out of bed and reach for my phone. I open a message my mother sent a few hours ago:

1:31 a.m.
Mother (Amelia)
He apologized. Now it’s your turn.
[LINK TO ARTICLE HEADLINED: “KOFFEE MORGAN RUDELY DISRUPTS DR. NOVUS LECTURE AT MORGAN INSTITUTE”]
2:23 a.m.
Me
Ok. I’ll call him.


I step out of the room, quietly closing the door behind me to give my father a call in Terry’s living room, sitting on his sofa.
My lips tremble as my phone rings, waiting for him to pick up. Is he even up at this time? He was yesterday. He gets upset when I wake him from his sleep, but I’ll gamble he’s awake. I hope I can rest tonight. If not, if he doesn’t pick up, I hope his phone is on silent, not bothering his sleep.
He picks up on the sixth ring. 
“What do you need?” He sounds awake.
I take a deep breath and cry. I know it’s annoying, and it affects my speech, but tears are something I can’t control. 
“Speak,” he groans—impatient. 
“I’m sorry I was being disruptful during Dr. Novus’s lecture a few days ago. I was helping someone who couldn’t hear very well, but Dr. Novus told me afterwards that he only used my name as a scapegoat and didn’t mean it directly and solely at me,” I manage to say in between hics. “He wasn’t offended at all.”
I wipe my tears and snot with my sleeve at my wrists. They glossily dampen the fabric, darkening it while also adding a sad layer of shine. 
“Mom says you’re sorry. That’s why I called,” I say.
“I’m not. She likes to spew bullshit.”
“Well—I am sorry.” I do my best to control my breaths. Inhale. Exhale. “It won’t happen again. I promise.”
“Let’s see if you can keep that promise, because I don’t care if the speaker meant it or not. You need better etiquette, or review the material on your own time. If our name is in headlines like that again—I won’t just pull your ear, Coughs. It’ll be more permanent.”
Coughs. Cough-Cough. I hate when people call me those. It’s not endearing at all. It makes me sound ill, but I guess it suits me right now. I feel sick—sick of myself. I wish I could throw up my own tongue.
Wait no. I don’t. That’s scary.
“Okay. But before I hang up,” I want to ask, “can you send me a picture of my insomnia medication? The formula specifically.”
“No.” He hangs up the line.
I didn’t get to tell him goodnight.
I wipe my nose with my sleeve again, and the snot stretches over a foot long. The moonlight shines on the string, making it appear as glass. I don’t move my hand, keeping it afloat like a spider’s web. Though unlike a web, it’s heavy, wet, and fragile. 
Terry slides out of his bed, and my heart stops. He walks out of his bedroom, into his kitchen in front of me yet not making eye contact. He opens a cabinet and tosses me a small white pill container. It was a perfect toss. He’s been awake for at least some time now.
“It’s over-the-counter,” he says. He returns towards his room but backtracks and stops to ask me, “Do you want a hug?”
“Did you hear?” I didn’t answer on speaker-phone, so I start trying to recall all my responses. Can Terry deduce our conversation based on only what I said? What did I say? 
Shoot.
He shakes his head. “Take it, and let’s go back to bed.”
We stare at each other, wondering what the other is thinking. Did he overhear my conversation with my father—how I apologized over getting ‘scolded’ at Dr. Novus’s lecture? Does he think it’s his fault? It’s not. 
“Oh. That’s right,” Terry softly mutters. “You need water for that.” 
I’ll trust him—that he didn’t hear. He only heard me up and crying due to stress, so he wanted to give me something to aid my sleep.
He comes around with a glass of cold water. I push down and twist open the medication bottle. There are only a few capsules left. I shake one out into the palm of my hand then read the front label. He bought forty-eight capsules. Then I look back inside to count before screwing back on the lid. Ten left. I didn’t know he took these."
2,Bentos,"“You reached Terrance—” 
My call went to voicemail again. Just like the last ten. Sometimes, in between, Terry would send me a text explaining why he couldn’t pick up: showering, studying, overtime, dinner with his family, napping. But since he never calls back or arranges time for us, it kind of feels like he just didn’t pick up.
It’s been two weeks since I caused Terry to miss the Pharmara lecture on transmuting beos to blood. And ever since then, he’s felt distant. I hate to admit I don’t have many close friends outside of him. After class and work, it’s lonely. Sure, I occupy my time with cooking for my parents, cleaning the house, exercise, and reviewing material, but there’s a silent disconnect. Socially, without him, I am alone.
There are these two friends from my class before I had skipped a school year: Emily and Dan, but they moved further south of the Astran District to lease two shops in a popular plaza: one is for Dan’s bakery cafe and across the street is Emily’s photography studio. They got married right out of high school and had a baby girl named Emma a year after. What is she now—two? The last time I met her, she was only five months old—a cute little dumpling.
My mother is often at work. Being director of all Morgan institutions is no easy job, but I know she takes on extra work to avoid coming home. Making breakfast and joining her is about the only time I see her outside of formal occasions, like ceremonies and networking events. 
My father—he’s always home. And I do try to talk to him, to repair a bond we used to have as father-daughter, but frankly, I don’t always have the energy for it. I should make better use of my time studying for the fellowship program, not only because Terry wants to do it together but also because Mother recently told me she agreed to this idea partly for me. An opportunity for me to test against other students, which she has the confidence I will score on top, and she says it’ll impress my father for sure. I’m not enthusiastic about competing against my class, but I do like studying for exams, mainly because I used to do it with Terry. Now, he ‘s doing it on his own.
I also have Maybelle, and we call from time-to-time. We don’t live so far from each other; she kept me in mind when moving out of our family’s house, which I’m thankful for. It makes her easy to visit and hang out with. She is my immediate family, so I’m glad we still share a bond. It’s too bad I hadn’t seen her the past two weeks. I’ve been at home, trying to take it easy on my leg, so I hadn’t visited her. And now I am in a depressing mood, bored and lonely. I don’t like to face her when I’m feeling like this. 
The Astran family is like a second home to me, but they’re busy. Besides their usual diplomatic and defensive duties, there was that attack on the Astran Spell Academy only a few months back. While there was thankfully only one casualty, I’m sure the series of public attacks has Solar and her family on their toes—not because they’re afraid for each other but because they’re worried for everyone else. Or maybe they’re not afraid at all. 
So on most days, I just have Terry and mutually, his group of friends. But when I’m in a desolate mood like this, I only want him. 
Stellar thing I can see him at work during today’s shift at the E.R. I still have a couple hours before I get ready for work, so I’ll prepare him something special. 

I arrive at the trauma center thirty minutes early—11:30 A.M.—badge in hand. The sensor at the check-in gate pulses as I swipe in. 
My first stop is the break room. There’s the sound of vending machines and someone microwaving their soup. From my lunch bag, I pull out two stacked bento boxes—one for me and one for Terry. I arranged his meal in an aesthetically pleasing way, and I am quite proud of this culinary, artistic side I discovered in myself today. His bento box features bean paste noodles with a white rice bunny laying atop, tucked under an egg omelet blanket I made. I even gave the bunny a face and two small hands. I also cut out eight-point stars from carrots and cucumbers. He’s going to be pleased. I know it. 
 I smile as I tuck them carefully into the fridge between a thermos marked ""MINE – Junnie ♥"" and a half-eaten fruit tart. Junnie is our charge healer and manages our operations, assignments, and staffing around here. Ever since one man ate her slice of pecan pie which she was excitingly saving for dessert five years or so ago, she started labeling her name on every food item she brings. Occasionally, when her husband bakes pies, she’d bring me a slice, and the note would read: “FOR KOFFEE – Love, Junnie & Doug ♥”. Junnie and I have known each other since I was young. She’s a good friend of my parents’ and a kind soul.
On my way to the locker room, Junnie spots me and shoots me a face of visible relief. “Thank the stars you’re feeling better. We missed you the past weeks,” she says, rubbing the back of my shoulder. “Zone C today. Light flow so far. You’ve got Room 12, 14, and overflow if it spikes.”
I flash a double OK sign, smiling. “Got it.”
The locker room was cooler than the halls outside, dimly lit with soft overhead panels and the quiet hum of the AC. The door clicks behind me as I walk in and slip off my coat and put it in the locker. I braid my hair straight down the middle then wrap it in a small bun and put on my scrub cap. Then I change into a clean pair of steel blue scrubs. 
With a few minutes still left on the clock, I take a slow walk through the near hallways, hoping for a chance to spot him while getting ready or chatting with our co-workers, but I don’t catch sight of him before our shift starts.

At 3:00 P.M., I go to the break room to have lunch. I open the fridge and pull out our bentos then sit down at the table. Dr. Lee grabs something out of the fridge as well then slumps next to me, leaving an empty chair in between us. 
“Hi,” I greet him, bowing my head. My hair falls, so I tuck it behind my ear. “How’s your day so far?”
“Today is not bad. It’s good you’re back. We’ve been short without both you and Terrance.”
Terry has lunch at this time too, but he's three minutes late now. “Did something happen to Terry? I didn’t see him during today’s shift.” Or for the past two weeks.
“Oh, he didn’t tell you?” Dr. Lee looks up at me after slurping a mouthful of cold soba noodles from his thermos. “Terrance switched departments a little over a week ago.”
My heart sinks but only a little bit. 
“Really? He didn’t tell me,” I laugh. I’d like to put my surgical mask back on, but I’m not skipping my lunch. So I untuck the hair I just put behind my ear, letting my hair cover my right side profile, in between me and Dr. Lee. Forcing a smile hurts my facial muscles, as if appearing blissful makes it less embarrassing that I didn’t know which department my own boyfriend worked in.
I open my bento, which looks less than plain. I prepared myself bean paste noodles and an omelet too. But while I gave Terry the star cuts of carrot and cucumber and a rice bunny, I gave myself the leftover scraps. I mean—it would’ve been a waste not to, and it tastes the exact same. So in that sense, maybe this was a dumb idea. His bento isn’t special just because it’s cute. In fact, I am thankful he isn’t here today. Preparing that bento as some sort of apology was a dumb idea, and I was in over my head thinking that he’d like to eat some pretty lunch while mine isn’t nearly as visually appealing. He would feel bad and switch our lunches. Then I’d be eating my apology gift to him. That’s just the kind of guy he is. 
Junnie opens the fridge and growls. Her crouched body twitches. The fridge’s light and cold air makes it look like she was steaming from the head.
 Did Dr. Lee take her thermos? It was the only one the last time I checked. 
“Is that Junnie’s…” I whisper at Dr. Lee and point at the thermos he’s eating from.
Quickly, he turns around and reveals to Junnie he had started eating her lunch. “I’m sorry,” he pleads. “I was hungry before work, so I ate the lunch my wife prepared me before the shift even started.”
The audacity he had to eat someone else’s lunch when there was a bold note with her name on it. If not buying lunch here, at least eat the unnamed fruit tart to attempt satiating your hunger first. Even so, I’m embarrassed I didn’t notice this crime sooner. I pat the empty table space across from me. “Junnie, I prepared an extra lunch. It’s not cold soba, but I think you’ll like it.” 
Her mood flutters. “For me?” she blushes. 
I nod. It was for Terry, but now it’s for her. I am glad that I put effort in it, hopefully matching her husband’s. 
She gives my shoulders a rocking hug then sits across from me before opening it. “Dear! This is so adorable. Thank you!” She pulls out her phone to snap a picture of the bento, sending it to her husband I suppose. 
I grin since she’s happy about the meal, but then I frown, realizing again that Terry deliberately didn’t let me know he switched departments over a week ago. "
2,Scheduling,"Filing an official report is a rather lengthy and tedious process. Stewart is impatient, but Maybelle and I insisted he rests up before we go. I understand he wants to reunite with Rina, but he’s severely sleep deprived and unfit for a rescue mission. Currently, he’s resting in Maybelle’s bed, while we head over to Solar’s home.
I called while we were on the train. No response. These days, only Maybelle picks up my calls. We stand outside their gate and speak into the intercom. “We’re here to see Solar I say.”
“Miss Astran is not home,” it says back.
“How about Domos?” Maybelle adds.
“Mister Astran is currently occupied with a matter.”
“For how long?” I ask.
“Long. Indefinite. Would you like to leave a message?”
Sigh. “No. That’s okay. I’ll send a text if I can’t get ahold of them,” I say. Eventually, that’s what ends up happening, because I visited multiple Astran facilities (academies, training grounds, recreation centers) only for not a single one of them: Domos, Solar, Aurora, or Nova to be there.

Apparently Dr. Pharmara’s wife, Rina, is being held hostage underground in some operation experimenting on pregnant women in Astan. He, Maybelle, and I will be checking it out and hopefully get her out safely. She’s eight months and due soon. Here are the coordinates (according to him): [ADDRESS]. I will be turning on my phone location in case anything goes wrong. Please help us if you are available.

We don’t need them, but if someone is going to know where we are (in case anything goes wrong and we don’t return) it’s best the Astrans know. 

Stewart is giving us three days of prep time before we go. Maybelle reschedules with her clients. Her work schedule is flexible, since she’s her own boss: a personal trainer and also martial arts sensei at a well-staffed dojo. I inform my professors in advance that I'll be missing the next lecture and make up for it at home. They can’t stop me anyway; there’s no attendance, and it only hurts my own academic performance. My work on the other hand, our E.R. department is… understaffed. There, people depend on me, and I already took two weeks off only a month ago because of my leg. 
I call Judy anyway as I head up the stairs of the entrance at Galaxine County Public Library. It’s the biggest, most beautiful library in all of Astran. And unlike most other libraries, it has a vast collection of beo magic and spell books able for checkout. Having the feeling Judy wouldn’t pick up, I step in through the automatic double doors. But she does pick up, so I step back out to speak with her, and I hit my face on the edges of the doors as they were closing behind me. 
Ouch. I shouldn’t have moved so rashly. My forehead hurts. I guess this time, I’ll heal the bump.
“Hi, Judy. I know I took time off very recently, but I was wondering if I could have Thursday and Friday off if possible. There is a personal emergency I need to attend to.”
I bite my lip. The answer is definitely a no. 
“Normally I’d tell you to request it in the system, but since it’s tomorrow and we’re swamped, I’ll tell you straight: no, unless you can find someone to cover your shifts. I’m sorry, dear.”
As I predicted. No one is even off tomorrow, so I’d have to ask outside our team.  “Okay. I’ll see. Thanks, Judy,” and I hang up the call, heading back in the library.
Soon after stepping in, I spot him. 
I’d recognize him from anywhere. I know my boyfriend from his hairline, his beauty marks, his light wrinkles, his wrists and hands, his lips, his knees, the shape of his feet, the tattoo on his ankle. Every part of his body is easily identifiable to me, except for that one place I haven’t seen.
His fluffy chestnut bangs ruffled out the face of his grey heavy cotton hoodie. He dresses like it's cold, even during the springtime. He’s wearing his black, oval rimmed glasses for reading especially small text. He has both ears plugged, using his white earbuds he’d share with me if we were side-by-side like before, listening to his mother’s cello. He’s studying and has a stack of books next to him. Just as he reported to me—if he’s not eating, showering, at the gym, or sleeping, he is studying. He’s not a liar, and he takes his education very seriously. Why did I feel uneasy before? That’s a good thing.
I don’t intend on bothering him. I stop by the front desk and ask a librarian for assistance, interested in learning beo strength training. After getting recommended and receiving two potentially helpful books, I sit far behind Terrance. He’s still in my line of sight, but I’m not exactly stalking him. I’m minding my own business. 
The books are thin—about forty pages each. The first book is titled: Haruno’s Guide on Typeless Offensive Focal Magic. ‘Typeless’ refers to nonelemental, meaning these techniques are purely physical and raw power rather than materializing fire or ice, which would then fall into the category of nonfocal magic if detached from the user’s body and thrown or shot like a projectile attack. The latter is less taxing on the brain but consumes more beos, varying by spell size and difficulty. I’m also not so good at long distance aiming. I’d rather just use my body or a bō staff. 
I skim the units first, scanning the text and diagrams. If I find these particularly useful, I’ll check them out and be on my way. 
Introduction. Partially skimmed then skipped. It’s just about S. Haruno’s background, credentials, her interests, and some pointers on how the rest of this book is formatted. 
Unit One: Beology — Perceiving and Understanding Yourself. Skimmed. [ADD]
Unit Two: [ADD]
My eyes gravitate towards him, and my cheeks flush. It feels weird sitting behind him yet he doesn’t know, even if I’m far back. 
Oh? He’s putting his head down. A nap. I hope his neck doesn’t hurt. Should I walk over and offer him my lap? Or would he just go home? I decide to stay seated and get back to skimming.
Unit Three: [ADD]
Unit Four: [ADD]
I glance up again, probably sneaking a dozen looks the past half hour. His head is up again, and he’s rubbing his neck. Poor baby. It’s like my eyes are magnetized, but he has his hood up so all I see is light grey. He pandiculates, yawning and stretching his arms over his head and to his sides. Then he sits up straight, reading again.
Unit Five: [ADD but cut off]
Nessa walks over to him and pulls off his hood. She waves, smiling and giggling. Doesn’t she know we’re in a library? It’s supposed to be silent. 
She runs her fingers through his hair.
She repeatedly pats his shoulder.
Why does she keep touching him?
Terrance gently rejects her hand, taking it off his shoulder, but she intertwines her fingers with his. What the heck? Who does she think she is? 
My head nearly bursts, but he shakes off her hand and gives her the middle finger. “Go away. I’m busy,” I hear him say from the distance. Yes, tell her to scram. You have a beautiful and intelligent girlfriend right here: me. I’m right behind you—by several tables, but I’m here. 
She pulls out a chair and sits across from him, meaning it’s possible for her to see me. I shrink, covering most of my face with S. Haruno’s guidebook, only leaving room above for my peeping eyes. 
Terrance slouches back, leaning against his chair and folding his arms as he faces her. He’s going to entertain a conversation with her. I get up from my chair and walk over to confront them. This is beyond disrespectful to me, your partner, and the entirety of the library! We’re sitting in a silent zone.
	As I make my way there, past the rows of big tables, I trip over someone’s briefcase. My body falling onto the floor creates a huge thudding noise, reverberating throughout the quiet space. Carpetburn on my elbows. I lost to a briefcase. People’s heads turn, so I stay down until everyone gets back to what they were doing. 
After getting up and finally making my way over to them, I stand at the edge of their table, tapping my fingernails on the surface. “What are you guys doing?” I smile, clenching my teeth and batting my lashes. 
Neither of them say a word. Terrance’s jaw is just dropped open and he looks down at my body, avoiding my gaze. His beos are circulating at a rather high speed. Got caught doing something wrong, perhaps? I wouldn’t say conversing is betrayal, but I just don’t get it. You flipped her off, so what’s wrong with me being here? Is my presence not wanted?
“Hi, Koffee,” Nessa greets me, unlike a certain someone. “I got here and spotted Terrance a second ago. I’m just saying hi.”
“Why were you touching him so much?” I admit to watching them.
She giggles, and Terrance still doesn’t say a thing. He faces away, covering his mouth with his hands as his elbow is propped on the table. We haven’t spoken face-to-face in months, and he has no words for me. It’s worse than our texts, which he at least acknowledges.
“Touching?” Nessa giggles. “Oh, I was just messing with him. You know we all go way back.” 
She reminds me once again that out of their friend group, I’m just the mutual friend introduced by Terrance. I’m not a true member of their circle. They’re the same age, and they’ve known each other much longer than I have. I’m the outsider. Between us five, I’ve always known that, and I’ve been okay with it since I had Terrance. But nowadays, is he even mine? Are we even friends?
I continue to stare at him, but he refuses to meet my eyes. I was right. He is upset with me, so the department change and the hollow conversations were all intentional. So why bother responding to my texts so sweetly on the surface if they were empty in feeling? My heart sinks. He won’t even look at me.
I try to fight back the tingling sensation fizzing in the tip of my nose. “I-If you’re not going to speak to me, then you can’t speak with her either!” I blurt, holding back a citric dam. I bite hard on my lip, my face scrunched. It sounds like insecure jealousy because that’s what it is, and I feel embarrassed now that it's out.
He finally looks up at me, registering what I said, then immediately starts packing the books into his bag. “Okay,” he complies.
Seriously? Does he really want nothing to do with me so badly that he’s willing to cut off Nessa?
He gets up and leaves, and I watch his back as he walks further and further from me. He exits the building’s doors. 
“Do you want to punch me?” Nessa says. 
“No.”
“I can see that vein popping out of your head, Koffee Morgan,” she sneers. “If it helps you blow off some steam, go ahead.” She stands up and peers her face forward, turning a cheek. 
“I don’t want to punch you. I’m not a violent person.”
“You can’t really say that,” she laughs. “Lying so blatantly. I honestly can’t wait until you snap at this grown age. Maybe then will you finally be expelled for your conduct.”
“What are you talking about?” She again annoys me, like almost every encounter we’ve shared before.
“You, genius. You are a violent person, and frankly, I don’t want to work with you.”
“You don’t even work with me, Nessa.” 
“One day, you’re going to become the Dr. Morgan and the medical director of these hospitals. It’s sickeningly ironic. You’re a bully, an abuser. You don’t belong in hospitality.”
“Who did I abuse? I’ve hurt no one.” 
“You got into physical fights starting from elementary all the way up until high school. Don’t forget what you did to poor little Mason. You’ve gotten detentions, suspensions, referrals—but they were all just a slap on the wrist. Little Miss Morgan is too privileged to face any lasting repercussions. Had it been anyone else exhibiting such deplorable behavior, they’d be rejected from Morgan University in an instant.”
“I don’t know how many times I have to say it. I did not hurt Mason! You’re the only one of us that believes that! Even Mason says I did nothing to him!”
“Your family paid him off. I know it.”
My mother paid his parents to say it. Back then, she would bribe families with bullied kids to say I was the bully, that I was the perpetrator. It was to explain all my injuries as a kid, since I’d walk out in broad daylight visibly hurt. I didn’t know magic, how to heal myself. Nowadays, I don’t care enough, but I’m grown. People don’t need to look after me. A bruised arm at twenty-one? I should’ve watched where I was going. A missing ear would be more concerning. That's why I got a new one.
These bullying allegations, some people found it to be a hot topic for gossip, but most people—people with critical thinking skills—found it hard to believe. Basil often came to my defense when Nessa would bring up this fake past. He’d say do you really think Koffee’d get roughed up so badly by these scrawny kids? And he’s right. The ways we were hurt, it looked like a close fight—maybe a draw. But if any of those kids and I were to actually fight, there’s no way I’d end up with so many concussions, busted lips, and bruises.
“So you’re going to keep provoking me. Do you realize what that would mean for you?”
“Is that a threat?” She bobs her head to the side, popping her eyes out like how Terrance habitually does for fun.
“Partially, because the walls aren’t the ones talking. Maybe one day you’ll get that reaction you want so bad out of me. And when that day comes, you’ll regret it. Because if breaking Mason’s nose wasn’t enough to prevent me from being a healer, what makes you think breaking yours will?”
A librarian taps Nessa’s shoulder from behind and faces both of us. “If you two have a lot to say, please take it outside,” she softly scolds. 
“Sorry,” I apologize. I head over to a kiosk to check out the library books. Both of them—the second one being about support spells and is authored by Zico Astran, Solar and Nova’s gruncle. From the corner of my eye, I see Nessa leave the library doors. What did she even come here for? Just to hurt my feelings? I hate that Terrance is friendly with her. She’s so mean to me. The fact that he finally agreed to stop talking to her only so that he doesn’t have to talk to me—wow. I can’t even say I’m surprised. He might choose me romantically, but that’s about it. There can be other reasons for that outside of love. Is it money? It’s definitely not lust, though he tells me I have a great body—after I ask. For platonic company and conversations, he chooses Nessa in every other instance. Being his girlfriend, aren’t I at least also his friend? 
I angle my neck down so that my hair covers my tears, and I make my way to the ladies bathroom to calm myself down, blow my nose, and refresh my face.
When I walk out of the library, a familiar hand pulls back my wrist. I spin around. Terrance had been waiting. For me? He doesn’t say much, not even a hello. He folds my arm up and starts healing the carpetburn on my elbows. 
“Were you the one that fell earlier?”
“Yeah,” I sniffle.
After he heals both my elbows, he pulls me in for a hug, our chests press together. I can feel his heartbeat: it’s steady. “I missed you,” he says.
“Are we still dating?” I pull away to ask.
“Of course.”
“Then why have you not wondered how I’ve been?” He should care. He should at least be curious. I don’t want to cry again, but I feel it coming. 
He twists his lips and looks up to think, inflating his cheeks with air like a squirrel stuffing its mouth with acorns. “I guess I feel I just know. You’ve been fine, right? How’s your leg?”
“It feels normal.”
“Good,” he nods, gently smiling. The amount of eye contact he’s giving me compared to before is starting to feel unsettling. His smile too. I have to look away. I don’t want him looking at me when my eyes and nose are all pink and puffy because of him.
“Are you busy Thursday and Friday?” I ask as I stare at his hand which holds his backpack strap at his shoulder. 
“I can be free. Do you want to hang out?”
“No. Can you cover my shift at the E.R.? For both days.”
“I could. Why?”
“Will you do it?”
“If you want me to.”
“I want you to. I’ll let Judy know, and she’ll contact you.” I walk down the steps and head for the train station. Before I get too far, I turn back to holler. “Wash her stinky hand out of your hair tonight—and your hands,” I laugh. Then I start to run off. My comment was a bit petty, but my spirits feel lifted now that Terrance talked to me. His effect on me is that simple. I also got to badmouth Nessa without hearing him go to her defense—there’s nothing better than that.
On the train ride back to Maybelle’s place, I tease him with a text: I might die.
Why? He responds the quickest he has in the past three months. 
Something dangerous ;)I like to keep him wondering, keep me on his mind. Seriously, don’t worry. Unless you don’t hear back from me. I love you <3
What are you doing? He asks. 
I don’t say anything. Do I want to involve him? No. Terrance is working my shift at the E.R. Besides, he’s not cut out for this kind of thing. I can’t be too sure Maybelle and I are either, but he’s definitely not. 
He gives me a call. Unlike him these past few months, I do pick up. I always do when I see his name.
“Are you being serious?” He asks. 
“I’m serious about going to do something possibly dangerous Thursday, but I was joking about dying. You know I’m not that weak,” I smug. The tease is over; I don’t want to worry him too much that he’ll take back taking over my shift. Like my own, his emotions are rather sensitive, and I shouldn’t take advantage of that.
“Can I trust you to prioritize your life?”
“Of course I want to live. I’ll call you when it’s over.” "
3,Scar Cream,"I go to my local pharmacy to pick up a prescription for a scar cream. In one of the aisles, I see Basil. Quickly, I do a 180 and flip on the hood of my hoodie. 
	“Hey!” I hear him call out. “Koffee Morgan! Don’t pretend we didn’t just make eye contact.”
	I turn around to respond. “I have to go,” I wave. 
	“Too busy to say hello?”
	“Hi, Basil.”
	“What do you have?” He dangles his hand in the air, referring to my prescription bag. “I’m waiting for something too. My grandma’s medication.” He sits in a chair.
	I walk towards the waiting area. Basil said he’d stay friends with me if I were to hypothetically break up with Terrance. Now the reason why, I don’t know. I can’t know for sure if it’s genuine. He’s known Terrance longer, so he should drop me if anything. If he doesn’t, it’s because I’m Koffee Morgan. It’d be beneficial to his career. If I tell him I’m dropping out, don’t plan on inheriting Morgan institute, or don’t even have a healthy relationship with my parents, would his stance change? I wonder. 
	I sit down next to Basil. “I got a scar cream.”
	“Scars? I know you get hurt often, but you don’t leave behind scars. Neither does Terrance.” He laughs light-heartedly. 
	“I made an oopsies,” I try to laugh too.
	“Bad enough for a prescription scar cream? Can’t something over-the-counter work fine?”
	I gulp. “Yeah. Bad enough.” 
	“There?” He points at me. I didn’t realize I was holding my lower right rib where the injury happened. 
	I nod, pursing my lips. 
	Basil twists his lips. “…Is Terrance hitting you? Has he been?”
	My eyes widen. “No. Definitely not. This… I fell on a broken broom stick. Terrance has only helped me from my clumsiness.”
	“You’re not clumsy.”
	He’s right. I’m lying. I’m not clumsy, but I lie some more. “You simply don’t see me often enough.” I start parting my hair, trying to reveal the scar on my head and show it to him. “See this? I tried to do a flip and landed on my head.” 
	His eyes narrow. He doesn’t buy it, but there’s no proof of what caused what, even with a scar and the memory. 
	“Do you want to see Terrance?” He points his thumb behind him, towards the pharmacy’s main doors. 
	“He’s here?” My voice shakes. Why didn’t he come in with Basil? I frown, biting my lip. “What are you guys doing?”
	“Stop it. You’re starting to scare me, Morgan. Making me think I’m good friends with an abuser.”
	“He’s not. I promise.”
	“Well, then Terrance, Nessa, and I got dinner together. They’re eating popsicles outside while I’m waiting for my grandma’s medication.”
	“Oh how nice,” my words come out flat. He was free. He was enjoying dinner with his friends. Not my friends. “No Lara?”
	“She’s cramming in some last minute studying.”
	Basil gets called up to pick up the medication. After he grabs the prescription bag, he spins around and points his fingers at me. As if it was a dance. “Well… Do you want to see him?” He asks me another time. 
I stand up, ready to leave, and shake my head. “Leave first. I don’t want to see him.” 
“So now you’re avoiding him too? This is your chance to see him.”
“I’ll see him before the exam—” I stop when I hear familiar voices enter the store. It’s Terrance and Nessa. My foot slides back. 
	My heart drops and I’m scared I’m going to be seen and ignored publicly. I’m scared he really doesn’t want to see me and acts like everything is casual. 
I bolt through the pharmacy’s emergency exit and run home. 

When I get home, I pick up my cracked phone from across my room. It still works. 
Terrance had given me a call only twenty minutes ago. Basil must have said something. But it’s too late. You’re a couple hours too late, Terrance. 
I unlock my phone, go to settings, and try to find a new lock screen. Searching through my photo gallery, it’s full of him, pastries, and pictures of my notes and textbook pages. I choose one of the default images. 
While lathering on the scar cream, on my front and back, I hear the doorbell ring. I go to answer the door. And when I crack it open to stick my head out, Terrance is standing there. 
“I saw you through the window talking to Basil… Why did you run?”
“I forgot to turn the stove off.” 
We stare at each other for a while, and a strong gust blows his hair. 
“I’ve been wanting to talk to you. Can we talk?” He asks. 
No. That’s supposed to be my line, not his. He’s breaking up with me? Not the other way around? No, ultimately it doesn’t matter. 
“Say it here.”
Another big gust howls. 
“The wind’s kind of loud. Can we talk inside?” He awkwardly smiles.
But my house is a mess, and I’m scared he’ll notice the broken lamp we have yet to get rid of. 
Terrance agrees to close his eyes as I lead him to my bedroom. When we get there, I also remember my broken mirror and dented wall because I threw my phone. So I lead us to the guest bedroom, and we sit on the bed. 
“Speak,” I tell him. 
“It kind of smells like blood in your kitchen. Did something happen?”
“Raw meat. Say what you want to say. Or leave.” My heart hurts thinking about what he might say next. 
He takes a deep breath before starting. “I’ve been stopping by your house, asking where you’ve been for the past couple of weeks. And when I finally got to see you again, you weren’t waking up.” Terrance fidgets with his fingers. “I visited you in the hospital. I wish you had let me know when you woke up and got discharged.”
“You wouldn’t have responded.” I bite my lip.
“I’m sorry,” his voice goes soft. So do his eyes, bubbling, looking at me, wanting my forgiveness. 
I feel my nose burn. My eyes begin to tear, but I can’t yet. This apology is not complete. I need to hear more. “For…” my voice cracks. 
“I’m sorry I haven’t been talking to you, seeing you when you wanted to.”
“Why didn’t you?” I cry and crawl closer to him, cupping his face. I hover my hand over his forehead. I want to know. I really want to know. “Can I read your mind?”
“What?”
“I can read people’s thoughts and maybe memories when I touch their foreheads.” 
He hastily pulls my hand off him, and I accidentally touch somewhere that we agreed to only bring out after marriage. 
‘“Sorry, but no,” Terrance apologizes. “I can explain it all to you.”
I keep my hands to myself.
“But how can I know if you’re telling the truth?” I wipe my eyes. 
“You don’t trust me?” He gives me a sharp look.
“I do, but…” I don’t know. I don’t think I do.
He gulps. “In the beginning, in March, I said I wanted to study separately because I felt most of our time together was just you helping me. And I didn’t want to take up too much of your time reviewing old concepts. We still hung out, had our dates and such. Things were fine between us.” 
“So what happened? If things were fine, why did you change that?”
He hesitates before saying it. “…You’re distracting.”
“How?” 
“I spent a lot of time tending to your injuries every day we met. And you don’t seem to care enough about yourself to separate yourself from harm’s way, so it all comes back to me, occupying my time. I don’t cause your pain, so it felt unfair fixing up every bruise and cut, but I—”
“You don’t cause me pain?” I cry. “You really believe that? You don’t know a joule of how much my heart aches for you, because of you!”
He’s silent. 
“You don’t need to heal every minor injury. If it’s so much labor to you, you don’t have to do it. But don’t ghost me for so long. I felt so alone.”
“Letting them stay on your body hurts me too. I don’t like seeing you hurt. It etches into my memory. Just seeing you distracts me. You occupy my mind every moment. When you get hurt, I notice it. And if I tend to your wounds, I don’t only spend my hours on healing treatment, I also worry when it’ll happen again. It always happens again.”
“Are you really apologizing?” Because it sure doesn’t sound like it. 
“Is the stench of blood really raw meat? Didn’t you just turn the stove off?”
I hear the front door open and slam afterwards. 
“My father’s home. You should leave.”
Terrance tugs my arm. “Come live with me.”
“No.”
“Please,” he begs. 
“No. Leave.” I eye the window. "
3,Of My Own Volition,"Terrance wants to do this fellowship program and learn more about magic pharmaceuticals. I’ll ask Dr. Pharmara to take him under his wing. I wish I could’ve already done that here, but my father refused and my mother, she drowns herself in work to hide pain. Everything I know, I don’t like crediting it to being Koffee Morgan— but I’d be lying if I said my privilege didn’t give me access to good schooling and other mentors. 
I pull out my phone and call Nessa. 
She picks up. 
“What?” She starts off. 
“Hi, Nessa. My father insists I personally congratulate all of the qualifiers for the National Healing Fellowship Program. Let’s meet.” 
“You already congratulated me enough last night, Koffee. Thank you though!” 
She nearly ends the call but I yell for her to wait. “But I have a gift. Your name’s engraved as well. I’d have to throw it out. It’d be a waste,” I pretend to ponder as if sad.  
“Engraved? In like what?”
“You’ll love it. Terrance loved his. Meet me at Aegis Park. Six o‘clock?” 

I meet Nessa under a street lamp at a public park. 
“Is the gift in your backpack?” She holds her hands out, waiting for me to place something extravagant in it. 
“Yes, it is, but I want to ask you something first.” 
“Sure thing, Morgan.” 
“Did I ever intimidate you?” I ask her as I rub my knuckles in front of my waist, hoping I’d appear to only be nervous.
She smiles, confused as to where I’m going. 
I don’t explain. 
I don’t need to. 
I punch her, straight to the face. Immediately knocking her out. She starts falling backwards. I catch her before her head cracks on the pavement. Those are no fun. 
I cast a sterile zone, cleaning her face, then snap her nose back into place and carry her on my back to a wooden picnic table, deep in the park. 
I open my backpack, which I prepared nails and a small sledgehammer. Getting to work, I lay her arms flat on the table. I hover a nail over one, then slam it down, through her hand. 
Nessa wakes up, screaming. “Are you fucking crucifying me?!” She’s hyperventilating, but I feel no sympathy for a rapist, drugger, and almost-homewrecker. 
“If you are quiet, I’ll give you some pain relief,” I whisper. 
“No! Just stop it!”
I give her a slap across the face then dig my nails into her skin, clawing into her jaw. “Be quiet,” I recommend. 
She complies. I make a local anesthetic and inject it in both arms before I continue hammering nails into her skin, barely pinning her to this picnic table since they aren’t long enough.
“You’re handling this well,” I graze her hand with the hammer.
“Why are you doing this?” 
“I’ve never liked you Nessa. You’re cruel, my bully. To think I was so drunk I offered you my spot in the fellowship program—I must’ve been out of my mind.”
“Tell your mom you want it back,” she cries. “You don’t have to do all of this!” 
“I know, I know. I could do that, but I’m doing this out of my own volition. I hate you.”
Six nails pinning down each arm. I’m out of nails. “Why don’t you try lifting your arms and running? I’m sure it’s not impossible.” 
“I’m scared,” she sobs. “You have a hammer.”
I use the sledgehammer to break each finger. I hear cracks. I see red and purple. They almost flatten like mush. Good. Next, I only have to heal it wrong. That way the damage is irreversible. With ruined hands like these, her career as a doctor will be over before it even begins. I am sorry for all her years of hard work, but she chose to do what she did. So I choose to do this.
“Do you think I’m going to kill you?” I’m not a killer. I start healing her bloody hands. 
She mumbles but can’t answer. 
“I’m not going to,” I assure her. “But even if you report me, remember what you said: Little Miss Morgan is too privileged to face any serious consequences. I think you were right about that. The most you’ll get out of me is a fake apology.”
“Is this because of Terrance?” Her voice quivers. 
“Terrance?” Slightly, I feel my heart drop. 
“You never did anything back to me when it was only you. This is more than personal, isn’t it?” 
I exhale. “You told Terrance I was trying to sabotage him. You ruined us. We broke up. This is personal.” Either way, it’s personal.
I clean the sledgehammer then pack it back into my backpack, zip it up, and make my leave. Before I get far, I tell her, “Get home safe, Nessa. You can go now. I won’t chase you.” 
She sits there crying. Perhaps she’s waiting for me to leave her range of sight before going. 
“Really, I won’t chase you. Should we pinky-promise?” I yell out to her. 
I walk home, yawning. 
That was a success. 

The next couple of days, I wake up to frantic texts from almost everyone I know. Even the people who haven’t spoken to me in years. They all either forwarded a news article and a surprised emoticon or asked if it was really me who did it. Terrance said nothing on the matter. 
I read the articles. They read I allegedly assaulted my classmate, ruining her hands beyond reversal. She’s pressing charges. Money is not a concern. My mother will cover for me.
Although my reputation as the dear Koffee Morgan has darkened to some extent, a surprising amount of people are still fond of me. Some even go as far to say I didn’t do it or that I must’ve had my reasons. The latter is true; I had my reasons. But in the end, she only got a couple ten million dollars, a fake apology, and a suspended license of mine out of me. It’s only going to be suspended for a short while, my mother tells me. Her hands and career, on the other hand, are gone forever. "
